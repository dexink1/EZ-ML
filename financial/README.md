# Earnings-History-Analyzer

Given a specific date, the main program predicts how stocks with earnings release on that day are likely to perform. The package also includes modules with the functionality of predicting how any given stock is likely to perform on its next earnings release date.  The program predicts performance based on a stock's past performance on earnings release dates.

The program requires the installation of Beautiful Soup 4 to run.

After installing all Python files, simply change the date under the link variable in main.py and run main.py to get the results.
